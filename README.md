## Hi I'm Marina Aoki

In my previous role as a clinical laboratory technologist, I was involved in specimen preparation, cytodiagnosis, and autopsy.
I also gained experience conducting internal audits based on ISO 15189 and serving as an external lecturer.

Later, at MsEngineer's bootcamp, I learned multiple programming languages, database design, and API design. 
I developed applications, such as a packing assistant app that alerts users about forgotten items using the Cloud Vision API.

Through development, I gained hands-on experience with both frontend and backend, but I found particular fulfillment in backend development. 
Moving forward, I am eager to deepen my expertise in this area.

I aim to leverage the accuracy and responsibility I honed in my previous career to contribute effectively as an engineer.
